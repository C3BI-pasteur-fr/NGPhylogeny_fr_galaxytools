      "Clustal Omega is a new multiple sequence alignment program that uses seeded guide trees and HMM profile-profile
      techniques to generate alignments. It offers a significant increase in scalability over previous versions.
      In addition, the quality of alignments is superior to previous versions, as measured by a range of popular
      benchmarks."

    long_description: >
      Gblocks eliminates poorly aligned positions and divergent regions of an alignment of DNA or protein sequences.
      Gblocks outputs several files to visualize the selected blocks. The use of a program such as Gblocks reduces
      the necessity of manually editing multiple alignments, makes the automation of phylogenetic analysis of large
      data sets feasible and, finally, facilitates the reproduction of the alignments and subsequent phylogenetic
      analysis by other researchers."
